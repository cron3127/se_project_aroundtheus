### Overview

- Project Description
- Figma
- Images

**Project Description**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In this project, more advanced html and css was used. Concepts related to grid along with elements that goes into responsive design such as rem, max-width and importance of percentages was used. Advanced git and bash techniques was implemented and Figma was introduced. Some plans to improve the project would include to make it more acessible to colorblind individuals as it only has one color scheme. Perhaps the option for user to click on the images/words to make it bigger for those that with difficult in their vision similar to how books published large print books for populations that need it. In additon, to make the site more useful to users, I recommend that user click on the image or name of place that leads to the website that provides more information. Perhaps a blog could be added as online reviews for sightseeing are very popular.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
